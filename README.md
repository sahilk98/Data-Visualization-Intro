# Data-Visualization-Intro
Introduction to Data Visualizations using Python.

This program serves as an introduction to plotting charts and highlights the differences in using the global variable API approach and the object oriented approach when plotting multiple figures or graphs. 

I built it to practise data visualizations using python, and is saved for further reference, if needed. 

Also, since it is made using Google colab, please click 'Open in colab' for the best viewing experience.
